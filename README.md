The VBU is going away.

Tonight (2024-8-2) Wubby made his stance clear on content reuploads like this and I don't think I could fully justify why another archive needs to exist even if I were to ask for his blessing. There was a lot of manual effort involved in maintaining the VBU Archive, but it was not at all transformative in any way and given Wubby's statements regarding what he's OK and not OK with, it wouldn't feel quite right to continue doing this.

For full context, I recommend watching the vod from tonight's stream: [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2214308924](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2214308924) (starts around 01:34:20)

Here's a few links to the already established Wubby archives:
